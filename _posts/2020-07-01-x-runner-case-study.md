### X-Runner for better health and environment in Lima Peru:

Almost 10 million people in Peru, or 30% of the total population, do not have access to proper sanitation due to increasing water scarcity and constant population growth. For many, nly poorly constructed sanitary facilities are available, which endanger the health and safety of families as well as the environment. 

x-runner is a social enterprise that provides a reliable, safe, and sustainable sanitation service to low-income urban families in Lima, Peru who are unable to afford toilets. They offer a complete sanitation value chain by linking a hygienic and waterless toilet for at-home use with a weekly service that removes and converts the human waste into compost.

### So, how did x-runner work before OpenFn?

x-runner managed its operations through paper forms, Excel spreadsheets, Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect mobile app, and Google Drive. With so many offline and online platforms, information was often scattered, making managing customers and tracking customer feedback difficult and time-consuming. 

### x-runner after OpenFn:

x-runner implemented OpenFn to connect its existing systems and sync data with a new Salesforce database to more effectively manage and monitor waste collection activities. With integrated systems the process now works as follows: 
- x-runner service operators pick up waste containers, scan a NFC tag attached to the container to pull up customer details, log service information via ODKCollect.
- OpenFn automatically syncs the customer data with Salesforce, updating customer details and logging the waste collection activities recorded.

x-runner management uses the Salesforce platform to monitor the waste collection services and track customer issues. Salesforce  reports help to easily identify issues for x-runner staff to immediately address.

With this integrated service system, x-runner can deliver high quality customer service and technical assistance to their customers, with no time lag.
