_In the past, it took KGVK months to digitize and analyze the data received from the survey before sharing static reports with key staff. Now using OpenFn, KGVK is able to monitor data in near-time and better serve the needs of their communities._

### KGVK is a non-profit organization with a mission to improve the livelihood of Jharkhand villagers.

KGVK has developed an integrated approach called the Total Village Management model (TVM). This approach, adapted to the rural setting, focuses on different key areas: natural resources management, education, renewable energy, livelihood, womenâ€™s empowerment, capacity building, resource mobilisation, infrastructure development, and health, nutrition, and sanitation. 

As part of the TVM intervention, KGVK administers an in-depth household survey to tens of thousands of beneficiaries around Jharkhand each year. This survey allows them to evaluate access to education, financial services, healthcare, and agriculture across the villages.

### However, it took KGVK months to digitize and analyze the data received from the household surveys before sharing static reports with key staff. 

Using OpenFn to configure ODK-to-Salesforce integration, KGVK was able to access dynamic dashboards of the village surveys. The ability to monitor data in near real-time enabled  faster analysis of the surveys so that KGVK could more quickly adjust their programs to better serve the needs of their communities.
