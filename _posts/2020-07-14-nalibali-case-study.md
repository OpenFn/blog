_Nal’ibali enforces academic success by promoting reading and writing in mother tongue languages which has changed education in South Africa. However, Nal’ibali’s system runs across multiple platforms, so it was difficult to monitor childrens’ activities and programs._

### Did you know that South Africa's education system ranks as one of the worst in the world?

The  results of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 2016 showed that 78% of Grade 4 learners in South Africa cannot read for meaning, which is the basis of learning. Children who aren’t good readers at a primary school level are on a trajectory of limited educational progress. Nal’ibali enforces academic success by promoting reading and writing in mother tongue languages which has changed education in South Africa. 

### What is Nal'ibali?

[Nal’ibali](https://www.nalibali.org/) (isiXhosa for 'here's the story') is a national reading-for-enjoyment initiative to use the power of stores, either oral or written and in many different languages, to inspire children to want to read and write. Since this campaign began in 2012, it has had a tremendous impact across South Africa through: 11,132 reading clubs (5220 of which are currently active), 159,191 participants, and 1,419, 035 stories distributed. 

###  Nal’ibali’s system runs across multiple platforms, so it was difficult to monitor childrens’ activities and programs.

Using Salesforce as its main M&E system and visualization tool, Nal’ibali wanted to integrate its mobile data collection data Open-Data-Kit (ODK) to facilitate monitoring and attendance tracking of training and literacy group meetings. Nal’ibali also wanted to integrate an online Learning Management system with its M&E database to track the entire program journey of a child beneficiary and their academic performance in one, single-view.

### Where OpenFn comes in...

To integrate its siloed data sources and introduce automated SMS to boost reader engagement, Nal’ibali implemented OpenFn to: 

1. sync all data collection tools across programs and activities for single-view monitoring, 
2. integrate Salesforce with Everlytic SMS to support direct communication with beneficiaries, and
3. enable live monitoring of its reach through a live, integrated map visualization that tracks the locations of reading clubs 

This OpenFn-powered system integrations save the Nal’ibali team several hours on data management processes and activity reporting every month. The connected data systems also ensure M&E staff can more quickly and easily monitor and analyze the performance of different reading clubs and campaigns across South Africa. To further scale its reach, Nal’ibali released a new online learning site earlier this year. Check it out at www.nalibali.mobi!
