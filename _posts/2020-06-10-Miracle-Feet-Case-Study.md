 _OpenFn connects MiracleFeet and its healthcare providers, getting better data into the hands of decision makers, faster, and allowing MiracleFeet to scale up their operations so that every child has access to clubfoot treatment._

### Clubfoot affects at least one of every 800 children, making it one of the most common birth defects in the world. 

Clubfoot is a birth defect that affects one in 800 children. MiracleFeet partners with healthcare providers in 26 different countries to deliver a simple surgery that allows children born with clubfoot to walk normally—but without secure, real-time data sharing, these partnerships would be siloed, separated by continents and culture, unable to learn from each other. OpenFn connects this global healthcare network, getting better data into the hands of decision makers, faster, and allowing MiracleFeet to scale up their operations so that every child has access to clubfoot treatment.

[MiracleFeet](http://miraclefeet.org) is a global health organization leveraging technology to improve treatment quality and outcomes for children born with clubfoot in low- and middle-income countries. MiracleFeet is increasing access to clubfoot treatment through partnerships with local healthcare providers, offering organizational, technical, and financial support to clinics in 26 different countries.

#### MiracleFeet develops CAST. 

In 2016, MiracleFeet was awarded a [$1M Impact Challenge Grant from Google.org](https://www.miraclefeet.org/2016/04/12/googleorg-awards-miraclefeet-one-million-dollar/) to implement healthcare technology to creatively address areas of clubfoot treatment in need of improvement. MiracleFeet developed a mobile-based data collection system called [CAST](https://www.miraclefeet.org/2018/02/15/new-mobile-app-clubfoot-treatment/), which allows healthcare workers to quickly view and collect patient information both online and offline. CAST supports workflows for clinic health workers, but it does not support reporting and data analysis across multiple clinics. Rather than subject clinic staff to hours of data entry and wait weeks for reports, MiracleFeet decided to invest in an integration solution to ensure accessibility, quality reporting, and timely, data-driven decision-making. 

#### MiracleFeet invests in OpenFn to deliver better patient care with secure, real-time health data integration.

MiracleFeet implemented OpenFn to deliver a flexible and scalable data integration solution that connects CAST and its central Salesforce health information system, avoiding costly investment (estimated $15,000 for setup alone) in a custom, inflexible integration solution. This OpenFn-powered solution allows MiracleFeet to: 
- Access and analyze information collected across all clinics in real-time. 
- Share data analyses and key metrics with other MiracleFeet staff, clubfoot partner organizations, and other external stakeholders. 
- Easily scale and expand its CAST rollout to other countries, by supporting easy setup of additional mobile-to-Salesforce integrations using OpenFn. 

In 2019, MiracleFeet implemented CAST to support clubfoot treatment in 180+ clinics across 26 countries. As CAST is implemented in additional countries, OpenFn scales and continues to empower MiracleFeet to actively monitor treatment outcomes across all clinics and adjust its programs as needed. Thanks to short trainings on data integration, provided by OpenFn, MiracleFeet staff have also learned to independently adjust the integration solution in minutes to match new country requirements and versions of CAST–saving time and ensuring total solution ownership.
