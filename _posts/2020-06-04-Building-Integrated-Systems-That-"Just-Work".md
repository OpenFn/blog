#### _Does your organization's information have an underlying structure? Try this exercise using boxes and crow's feet._

It’s Saturday Morning in Cape Town and I’ve just spent an hour talking about how a non-profit is organized. I thought I was getting into a technical discussion—I’ve been doing system architecture discussions for years—but what we ended up talking about was how this NGO thinks.

This engagement is largely about mapping an already existing “people & paper” based system to technology. Vera Solutions will build a system for this client using Open Data Kit for field data collection and Salesforce.com for the management “back-end”. Because we’re not explicitly being asked to help redesign processes at this organization, the client is “telling us how things are”, then expecting us to create a relational database model that facilitates business-as-usual, only in a more efficient, digital way. Seems reasonable.
