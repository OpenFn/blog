### Sinapis is accelerating small business development across Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda with their innovative training program.

Their passion is growing small and growing businesses (SGBs) that are typically made up of 5 to 250 employees. Sinapis found these small companies account for up to [80% of new job growth](https://sinapis.org/job-creators-why-small-and-growing-businesses-are-essential-to-recovering-from-a-pandemic/), fueling their respective economies.

[Sinapis](https://sinapis.org/) is a nonprofit organization that empowers aspiring entrepreneurs with innovative ideas by providing training, mentoring, consulting, and seed capital. Sinapis was one of the first organizations in Africa to start a program that trained entrepreneurs, including programs on developing business ideas, how to scale, and tools for accelerating growth. 

### However, Sinapis's data mangement process took staff hours to complete and was prone to data entry. 

Sinapis uses Salesforce to manage its different programs and entrepreneurs and to track payments made for programs. To collect these payments, Sinapis uses Kopo Kopo, a robust payment platform that accepts and processes M-Pesa payments automatically. Kopo Kopo, however, was not integrated with Salesforce, so Sinapis staff would have to repeatedly export, update, and review entrepreneur payments to identify overdue payments and share balance updates with entrepreneurs.

**OpenFn makes Sinapis staff’s lives easier by:**
1. Automatically syncing all payment data between Kopo Kopo and Salesforce,
2. Providing real-time monitoring of all account balances,  
3. Reconciling all payments to ensure correct assignment to matching accounts,  
4. Automatic account balance updates and identification of outstanding payments. 

This payment integration has saved Sinapis hundreds of manual hours and ensures that all payment information is always accurate up-to-date. This enables Sinapis to run smoothly and focus on helping its entrepreneurs rather than data entry.  In 2018 and 2019 alone, Sinapis employed 4,863 people and impacted over 24,000 lives by creating jobs for those in extreme poverty. Check out Sinapis’s [2018-2019 annual report](https://sinapis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2018-19-Sinapis-Annual-Report-Digital-Version.pdf) to learn more about their impact.
