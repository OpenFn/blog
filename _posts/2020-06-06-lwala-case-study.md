#### _OpenFn is helping small-scale farmers break the cycle of poverty with an automated savings & supply chain system.Small-scale farmers are feeding the world, but a majority of them are in an endless cycle of poverty and lack access to traditional banks and financing._

### Here's the overview.

[myAgro](https://www.myagro.org/) has pioneered an innovative bankless savings
plan that allows thousands of farmers to finance themselves and invest their
money in high-quality seeds, fertilizer, tools, and training. OpenFn automates
myAgro’s mobile layaway platform, powering a system where farmers can
incrementally pay for agricultural inputs by purchasing savings vouchers in
local stores—making deposits via SMS. myAgro holds those layaway payments until
planting time, when bulk purchases of seeds, fertilizers, and tools are
delivered to the farmers based on individualized plans.
