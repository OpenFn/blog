### Skateistan is an innovative organization founded in Afghanistan, now also working in Cambodia and South Africa, to empower children through skateboarding and education. 

They are youth-focused, supporting children in conflict and inequality in some of the most troubled areas of the world. Before, there were few investments in Afghan youth even though 70% of the population is under the age of 25. Skateistan’s Skate Schools worldwide provide over 1,800 children and youth access to education and opportunities. 

To better manage its programs and fundraising, Skateistan implemented Salesforce to provide one, central platform for data management, program monitoring, and donation tracking. 

### While Salesforce provided a better platform for tracking donors, Skateistan still used external payment apps to collect donations, and therefore needed a way to sync payments with its donor list.

In 2016, OpenFn implemented a Paypal integration to ensure donations could be automatically registered in Salesforce as soon as donor payments were made. 

This helped Skateistan’s fundraising team monitor incoming donations and more easily follow up with donors, improving targeting fundraising efforts and ensuring staff didn’t have to waste time reconciling  payments between systems.
